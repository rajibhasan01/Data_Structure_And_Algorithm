Algorithm
-> A set of steps a program takes to finish a task.

Efficiency
------------
1. Time --> Time compexity
2. Space -> Space compexity

Big O (is a notation to describe the compexity)
-> Theoretical definition of the compexity of an Algorithm as a function of the size.
-> Here O means order of magnitude of compexity.

Linear Search -> O(n)
Binary Search -> O(log n)

* Quadratic Runtime ---> n^2
* Cubic Runtime -------> n^3
* Quasilinear Runtime -> n log n (Ex- Merge Sort (worst case))
* Polynomial Runtime --> n^k
* Exponential Runtime -> x^n (Ex- Brute Force)
* Factorial Runtime ---> n! (Ex- Traveling Salesman)

In merge sort it first need to split all the number as we know the worst case in binary search is log n so. it takes log n time then its needs n times of comparision thats why in worst case it take O(nlogn). 

Factorial
----------
n! -> n(n-1)(n-2)...(2)(1)
